# dromas  - With Haskell it's an early runner. 
# zoobits - It's more wild in Idris but that's how this started.

Well first off the bat its indexed linear monads for fun and profit.
Maybe we can do all the state controlled stuff in QTT 
or do we really need indexed monads? If its an eDSL we are after
then the do notation is nice.

This was inspired by [Qimaera](https://github.com/zamdzhiev/Qimaera)

So far we have a linear version of Conor's DVDDrive example from SO.

Watch this space for more lolipops and zoo creatures. Not sure where 
this is going but it's cool enough that we can delegate even more 
correctness to the type checker.
